TinyIRRDBCache
==============

Manages a local cache of various Internet Routing Registry Databases (IRRDs) for quick lookups.

The API is rudimentary, the main value of this code is in the efficient caching.

Notes/Known Issues
------------------
    
 - Not for production use, just serves as an Example(TM)
 - **The binary file on disk can get corrupted if the process is killed at the wrong time or network connection is lost**
 - Only tested with nodejs v0.10.36
 - Lots of stuff is hard coded
   - database addresses
   - http server port (near end of file)
   - tmp file path/names/suffixes (search code for '/tmp' and '.tiny')
 - The server does not expose all potential functionality
 - Different API calls return differently formatted results (see below)

Usage
-----

 - Download the file and run "node *filename*"
 - Wait for databases to be cached (signified by "Exported *dbname*")
 - When rerunning and cache files are found, wait for "Import done; *dbname*"

try
 - curl localhost:8086/ripe/AS-CHAOS/v6
   - gets all v6 prefixes for that macro from the ripe DB
 - curl localhost:8086/radb/15169/v4 | less
   - gets all v4 prefixes for AS15169 (Google). Note the formatting
 - curl localhost:8086/radb/15169/v6 | less
   - gets all v6 prefixes for AS15169, encoded in the same way as the v4 addresses (sorry)
 - curl localhost:8086/dump | less
   - gets a JSON dump of everything that has been cached


Hacking
-------
    
 - convenience functions to convert between different IP representations are found near the beginning of this file
 - consistent API call results (e.g., IP formatting) would be sensible
 - database details and file paths as well as server listen address should go into a config JSON
 - temporary files should be used when writing caches, atomic (fs-level) rename once successful
 - forks welcome (via github, or email patches to tkr at ecix net)
